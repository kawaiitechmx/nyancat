Nyancat PCB KiCad project 

The footprints of this project had been modified.
- SW_SPDT_PCM12 removed mechanical pin
- LED_WS2812B_mini3535 larger pads than original footprint

This boards uses ATTINY85 with WS2812B-3535 package.
Use J1 pads to program ATTINY with ICE programmer or Arduino ISP.
Arduino sketch based on Adafruit's rainbow chaser.
